Question-1:

List down at least three main assumptions of linear regression and explain them in your own words. To explain an assumption, take an example or a specific use case to show why the assumption makes sense.

Question-2:

Explain the gradient descent algorithm in the following two parts:

Illustrate at least two iterations of the algorithm using the univariate function 
J(x) =x^2+x+1 Assume a learning rate  η=0.1 and an initial guess x0=1 and demonstrate that the iterations converge towards the minima. Also, report the minima (which you can compute using the closed form solution).

Illustrate at least two iterations of the algorithm using the bivariate function of two independent variables 
J(x,y)=x^2+2xy+y^2. Assume a learning rate η=0.1 and an initial guess (x0,y0)=(1,1). Report the minima and show that the solution converges towards it.
